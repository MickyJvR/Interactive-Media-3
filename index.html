            This is the basic way that we work with HTML. <br />
            I can make things <strong> BOLD,</strong> <br />
            <i> ITALIC</i>,<br />
            and even <s> crossed out.</s><br />
            <p> <span style="color: crimson"></span></p>
        </p> <br />
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            Sometimes you will want to quote something:
            <blockquote>We can do this too. It's just about knowing the right HTML tags.</blockquote>
